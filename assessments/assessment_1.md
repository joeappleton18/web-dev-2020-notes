## Assessment Task

The practical outcomes for this unit are to create a responsive single page web-application supporting students in their university experience. This idea has been proposed by our industry partners - Dootrix. They will be presenting their ideas in the first lecture of the term so it is vital you attend.

This assessment represents the exploratory phase of the wider project. Specifically, you are trying to find out in what ways students are underserved in their day-to-day university lives and how a web-application could help. Your findings, proposed solution and user feedback of the solution will form the basis of this current assessment. 

## Deliverables

You are required to deliver an academic styled report. As such, you should ensure you write in a formal style. Furthermore, you should use high-quality references to underpin your work.

You will submit the completed piece of work as a single PDF file. 

## Report Structure

## 1. 0 Introduction

This section should provide a background to the problem that you are addressing, the approach you used to explore the problem and your key finding. Finding good quality sources to underpin your arguments strengthen this section.

## 2. 0 Methods/Methodology

### 2.1 Overarching Methodology

You should provide a summary of the overarching methodology that you are using. Dootrix recommends using a design thinking methodology to conduct this exploratory phase of the project. You are, however, free to choose a different methodology if it better fits your needs. Moreover, you may also cherry-pick elements of multiple methodologies.  Regardless of the methodology you use, it must be clear that you have engaged with key sources and taken an organised, systematic approach to follow your given methodology.

### 2.2 Methods

Methods can be considered the tasks, tools and techniques that you used to gain an understanding of the proposed problem and allowed you to present and test a solution. Within this section, you will outline the methods you used.

The methods will be very much dictated by the methodology that you have chosen. What is key, is you will need to test your ideas on a representative base of students. Typically, you will follow some sort of iterative process, where you engage with student demographics to define the problem and determine how they are underserved. Next, you will develop a simple prototype using a tool such as Invision or Figma to test your ideas on this student demographic. 


## 3.0 Ethics

A brief account of the ethical considerations and acknowledgment that you have gained ethical clearance (e.g. ethical clearance and data privacy).

## 4.0 Discussion and Results

This section presents the finding and outcomes of the methodology and methods that you employed. The primary focus will be on the outcomes of user testing and the sentiment of your prototype.

## 5.0 Conclusion

Conclude your overall finding and based on these finding and adjustments that need to be made to your proposed solution when progressing the project.

## Reference List

A list of sources that you used throughout your report.

## Appendix

Included any additional information, such as mock-ups and ethics forms.

## Assessment Criteria

You will be assessed on your ability to critically explore the needs of your user demographic and propose an innovative solution.

### Learning Outcomes

This assessment will enable students to demonstrate in full or in part the learning outcomes identified in the unit descriptors.

### Late Submissions

Late Submissions:

i. If this assessment is submitted late i.e. within 5 working days of the submission deadline, the mark will be capped at 40% if a pass mark is achieved;  
ii. If this assessment is submitted later than 5 working days after the submission deadline, the work will be regarded as a non-submission and will be awarded a zero;  
iii. If this assessment is being submitted as a referred piece of work (second or third attempt) then it must be submitted by the deadline date; any Refer assessment submitted late will be regarded as a non-submission and will be awarded a zero.

### Extenuating Circumstances

The University’s Extenuating Circumstances procedure is in place if there are genuine circumstances that may prevent a student submitting an assessment. If students are not 'fit to study’, they can either request an extension to the submission deadline of 5 working days or they can request to submit the assessment at the next opportunity (Defer). In both instances students must submit an EC application with relevant evidence. If accepted by the EC Panel there will be no academic penalty for late submission or non-submission dependent on what is requested. Students are reminded that EC covers only short term issues (20 working days) and that if they experience longer term matters that impact on learning then they must contact the Student Hub for advice.

A summary of guidance notes for students is given below:

[http://portal.solent.ac.uk/documents/academic-services/academic-handbook/section-2/2p-extenuating-circumstances.pdf?t=1534423896787](http://portal.solent.ac.uk/documents/academic-services/academic-handbook/section-2/2p-extenuating-circumstances.pdf?t=1534423896787)

### Academic Misconduct

Any submission must be students’ own work and, where facts or ideas have been used from other sources, these sources must be appropriately referenced. The University’s Academic Handbook includes the definitions of all practices that will be deemed to constitute academic misconduct. Students should check this link before submitting their work.

Procedures relating to student academic misconduct are given below:

[http://portal.solent.ac.uk/support/official-documents/information-for-students/complaints-conduct/student-academic-misconduct.aspx](http://portal.solent.ac.uk/support/official-documents/information-for-students/complaints-conduct/student-academic-misconduct.aspx)

### Ethics Policy

The work being carried out by students must be in compliance with the Ethics Policy. Where there is an ethical issue, as specified within the Ethics Policy, then students will need an ethics release or an ethical approval prior to the start of the project.

The Ethics Policy is contained within Section 2S of the Academic Handbook:

[http://portal.solent.ac.uk/documents/academic-services/academic-handbook/section-2/2s-university-ethics-policy.pdf](http://portal.solent.ac.uk/documents/academic-services/academic-handbook/section-2/2s-university-ethics-policy.pdf)

### Grade marking

The University uses a letter grade scale for the marking of assessments. Unless students have been specifically informed otherwise their marked assignment will be awarded a letter grade. More detailed information on grade marking and the grade scale can be found on the portal and in the Student Handbook.

[http://portal.solent.ac.uk/documents/academic-services/academic-handbook/section-2/2o-annex-2-assessment-regulations-grade-marking-scale.pdf?t=1534424273208](http://portal.solent.ac.uk/documents/academic-services/academic-handbook/section-2/2o-annex-2-assessment-regulations-grade-marking-scale.pdf?t=1534424273208)
