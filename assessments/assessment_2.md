## Assessment Task

The practical outcomes for this unit are to create a responsive single page web-application supporting students in their university experience.  This idea has been proposed by our industry partners - Dootrix.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
This assessment represents the delivery phase of the project.  You can focus on two routes design and development (see below). Regardless of the route chosen, a single page JavaScript application tested with users will be delivered. Supporting this delivery will be 2000 words of documentation outlining the process.

## Deliverables 

As part of your implementation your should produce a `documentation.md` file which will be 2000 words in length (+/- 10%), it will document and justify the choices that you made throughout the project. It does not need to be academic in style, however, it should not be chatty. In line with the style, instead of citations you should use hyperlinks. Importantly, you must show that you followed a methodology. For instance, if you are using agile, your user stories and interactions will be documented - beyond this, the structure is a fee choice. `documentation.md` will be exported as a pdf and uploaded to SOL.

## Focus 

You are free to pursue two different routes - design  and development. 

### Development Focused

If you choose this route, your solution should be a modern single page web application (SPA) conforming to professional standards. Design is still important and should not be overlooked, however, the primary focus is show technical rigour and elegance in your solution.  Pursuing this route will require you to demonstraight:

- A professional README.md file 
- Database persistence 
- Authentication 
- Unit testing (advanced)
- High fidelity mock ups (these do not need to be validated with your audience)
- Cloud function (advanced)
- Evidence that the final solution has been evaluated by sample users

### Design Focused

Should you choose this route, you will still be creating single page web application, however, the main focus is to demonstrate and validate conceptual design ideas. As such, you may not need to make API calls, and interact with a database. Instead,  you can use place holder data to create a proof of concept. Pursuing this route will require you to demonstraight:

- A professional README.md file 
- Multiple interactions of  user research to validate your prototype (e.g. interviews, surveys and focus groups). This must be done with a realistic use-base
- Design inspiration
- Extremely high quality and unique designs have been implemented into a single page web application.
- Hi-Fidelity Wire Frame


## Assessment Criteria

You will be assessed on your ability to implement and document a high quality solution to the problem you defined in assessment

### Learning Outcomes


This assessment will enable students to demonstrate in full or in part the learning outcomes identified in the unit descriptors.

### Late Submissions

Late Submissions:   

i. 	If this assessment is submitted late i.e. within 5 working days of the submission deadline, the mark will be capped at 40% if a pass mark is achieved;  
ii.	If this assessment is submitted later than 5 working days after the submission deadline, the work will be regarded as a non-submission and will be awarded a zero;  
iii.	If this assessment is being submitted as a referred piece of work (second or third attempt) then it must be submitted by the deadline date; any Refer assessment submitted late will be regarded as a non-submission and will be awarded a zero.

### Extenuating Circumstances

The University’s Extenuating Circumstances procedure is in place if there are genuine circumstances that may prevent a student submitting an assessment. If students are not 'fit to study’, they can either request an extension to the submission deadline of 5 working days or they can request to submit the assessment at the next opportunity (Defer).  In both instances students must submit an EC application with relevant evidence.   If accepted by the EC Panel there will be no academic penalty for late submission or non-submission dependent on what is requested.  Students are reminded that EC covers only short term issues (20 working days) and that if they experience longer term matters that impact on learning then they must contact the Student Hub for advice.


A summary of guidance notes for students is given below:  

[http://portal.solent.ac.uk/documents/academic-services/academic-handbook/section-2/2p-extenuating-circumstances.pdf?t=1534423896787](http://portal.solent.ac.uk/documents/academic-services/academic-handbook/section-2/2p-extenuating-circumstances.pdf?t=1534423896787)

### Academic Misconduct

Any submission must be students’ own work and, where facts or ideas have been used from other sources, these sources must be appropriately referenced. The University’s Academic Handbook includes the definitions of all practices that will be deemed to constitute academic misconduct.  Students should check this link before submitting their work.

Procedures relating to student academic misconduct are given below:


[http://portal.solent.ac.uk/support/official-documents/information-for-students/complaints-conduct/student-academic-misconduct.aspx](http://portal.solent.ac.uk/support/official-documents/information-for-students/complaints-conduct/student-academic-misconduct.aspx)

### Ethics Policy

The work being carried out by students must be in compliance with the Ethics Policy. Where there is an ethical issue, as specified within the Ethics Policy, then students will need an ethics release or an ethical approval prior to the start of the project.

The Ethics Policy is contained within Section 2S of the Academic Handbook:

[http://portal.solent.ac.uk/documents/academic-services/academic-handbook/section-2/2s-university-ethics-policy.pdf](http://portal.solent.ac.uk/documents/academic-services/academic-handbook/section-2/2s-university-ethics-policy.pdf)


### Grade marking

The University uses a letter grade scale for the marking of assessments. Unless students have been specifically informed otherwise their marked assignment will be awarded a letter grade. More detailed information on grade marking and the grade scale can be found on the portal and in the Student Handbook.
